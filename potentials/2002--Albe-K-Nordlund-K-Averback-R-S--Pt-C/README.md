# 2002--Albe-K--Pt-C

## Implementations

- [Tersoff_LAMMPS_AlbeNordlundAverback_2002_PtC__MO_500121566391_002](https://openkim.org/id/Tersoff_LAMMPS_AlbeNordlundAverback_2002_PtC__MO_500121566391_002) in OpenKim
- PtC.tersoff taken from https://github.com/houzf/ABOP_lammps
- PtC_abop.tersoff generated here from PtC.abop

Perfect agreement seen between OpenKIM and PtC_abop.tersoff.  PtC.tersoff values *do not* match and appear to have swapped the ABOP Pt-C and C-C parameters.

## Status

PtC_abop.tersoff should be uploaded to the NIST Interatomic Potentials Repository as 2002--Albe-K--Pt-C--LAMMPS--ipr1.

Pull request should be made to correct PtC.tersoff
