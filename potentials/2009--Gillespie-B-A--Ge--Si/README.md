# 2009--Gillespie--Ge and 2009--Gillespie--Ge

## Implementations

- Ge.tersoff and Si.tersoff taken from https://github.com/houzf/ABOP_lammps

Parameters seem to match those in the Tersoff table found in the online table extracted from the thesis.  Unable to find the full thesis. 

## Status

Run tests to see if the tersoff potentials can be verified against any of the other thesis figures.  Build sw potentials as well?
